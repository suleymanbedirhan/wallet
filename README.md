## Getting Started

can make credit or debit on a player account with globally unique transaction id.

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the 'main' method in the 'com.suleyman.wallet.WalletApplication' class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

mvn spring-boot:run
```
After application is started successfully.
